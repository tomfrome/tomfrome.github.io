The goal is a collaborative blog/political commentary site where the central conceit is 
that all of the articles are written in dialogue between opposing viewpoints. See for 
example Malatesta's At the Café, Plato's Republic, or Joly's Dialogue in Hell Between 
Machiavelli and Montesquieu. Except serialized, short form, not book-length, and relating
to current events. Specific interests will include Marxism, feminism, and the debunking
of commonplaces and clichés.
